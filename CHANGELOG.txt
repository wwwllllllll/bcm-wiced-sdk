Example Applications
  * appliance configuration : new application to demonstrate configuration of a device using AP/client mode, DHCPS, DNS, WPS, webserver (FreeRTOS/LwIP only)  
  * web server application : added UART-buttons web page, added WPS example, improved uploading functionality
  * sensor application : added DNS server, any text may now be entered into the browser URL
  * console application : added join_wps command
  * ping example application : added WEP example code
  * mfg_test application : removed, now available as a separate manufacturing test download
Tools, Build System, RTOS, IP Stack
  * Added detailed instructions for importing ThreadX-5.4 & NetX-5.3
  * Cleared windows PATH environment variable to minimise the risk of existing installed tools breaking the WICED build process
  * Added UART tx/rx non-blocking read and break
  * OpenOCD updated to fix FreeRTOS thread awareness bug and to support STM32F2XX
  * Cleaned up the definition of SYSTICK and CPU_CLOCK_HZ
  * Re-arranged vector table and exception handler assembler files for BCM94319WICED1 
    to allow better compatibility with ThreadX
  * Modified host_rtos_create_thread() to support generic thread creation. Thread stack,
    stack size, and thread priority are now function arguments.
  * wiced_rtos.h must now define a number of macros and constants to inform WICED how to
    prioritize threads and how to allocate thread stacks
  * Updated GNU ARM toolchain based on gcc-4.6.1, binutils-2.21.1a, newlib-1.19.0, gdb-7.3.1, expat-2.0.1, gmp-5.0.2, mpc-0.9, mpfr-3.0.1
    Allows debugging of release builds, and reduces size of debug builds by fixing --gc-sections option 
  * Added IAR compiler support for FreeRTOS-LwIP builds 
  * Modified build and debug system to support different host microprocessors with
    different OpenOCD initialisation processes. Platforms must now define HOST_MICRO variable.

Changes for WICED-SDK-0.6 : 17 June 2011
----------------------------------------
* Reformatted all Broadcom code to use a uniform coding style
* Memory usage reduction, including:
   - Better control of stack and packet buffer sizes
   - Remove printf() usage from WICED and TCP/IP threads to reduce stack requirement
   - Remove all printf() usage from the release build of the canned_send app to minimize RAM usage
   - FreeRTOS and LwIP now use malloc/free functions from libc (newlib)
* Moved Wi-Fi firmware image from header file to .c file.
* Standardised usage of stdint.h types and changed bool to wiced_bool_t to avoid clashes
* Wi-Fi firmware download improvements to minimise download time
